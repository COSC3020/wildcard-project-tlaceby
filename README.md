# Wildcard Project

You have a cool idea for an algorithms project? Use this repository. Make sure
to explain what problem you're solving, how you're doing it, and that you test
your code.

**SOLUTION**

I have been annoyed trying to keep track of what challenges I have approved/requesting changes etc... So I created a script using nodejs and github cli to fetch all repos and keep track of what challenges I have done, in progress and what feedback I have recieved.

The code is located at [my github repo here](https://github.com/tlaceby/cosc-3020). I also have pasted the main.ts file which is probably out of date unless you check the GitHub repo above.

The output of the code produces a markdown file which looks like this:

```md------------------------------- REPOS   -------------------------------

```

This is the current view of my completed.md file which is generated by running

```bash
npm run 3020 tlaceby check
```

It uses the gh cli tool to fetch a repo and check it's pull request status.It does this for all 35 repos which I am apart of for this class. Then it will categorize them into a helpful markdown file which I can view and have always up to date with a single command.

This script is also pretty fast as I am using async to fetch all repos status at the same time and process it concurrently. This means it's super fast and not a hastle to use like it was earlier.

Feel free to checkout the code and let me know what you think. Overall this will help me keep track of what progress I am making in this class and even better, when you approve this request I will be able to see the change update with a simple run of the command.

Thanks.
